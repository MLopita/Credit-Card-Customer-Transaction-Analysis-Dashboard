# Credit Card Customer & Transaction Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves building **two interactive Power BI dashboards** to analyze credit card **customer profiles** and **transaction behavior**.  
It provides actionable insights into customer demographics, income levels, spending patterns, and credit usage trends.

The dashboards were designed as part of a Power BI analytics project to demonstrate data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard storytelling skills.


## Objectives
- To visualize **key customer metrics** such as demographics, income, and card usage.  
- To analyze **transaction trends** by expenditure type, week, and card category.  
- To enable interactive exploration through **filters and slicers** for:
  - Gender (Male / Female)
  - Age Group (18‚Äì25, 26‚Äì35, 36‚Äì45, 46‚Äì55, 56+)
  - Income Group (Low, Medium, High)
  - Card Category
  - Transaction Week

   - Card details (Card Category, Credit Limit, Annual Fees)
2. **Transaction Data** ‚Äì Contains:
   - Transaction Date, Amount, Category, Type (Swipe / Chip / Online), and linked Customer ID  


## Data Modeling & Transformations
- Merged customer and transaction datasets using **Customer_ID** as the primary key.
- Performed data cleaning and transformation in **Power Query**.
- Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX**, including:
  - `Age Group`
  - `Income Group`
  - `Total Revenue`
  - `Credit Usage %`
  - `Week Number`
  - `Current Week Revenue`
  - `Previous Week Revenue`
